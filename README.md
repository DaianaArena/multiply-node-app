# Multiply Node-App

## About this project

To complete this project, I utilized my knowledge of Node.js to create a command-line interface that accepts user input for the multiplication table they want to generate and the number of iterations. The application then creates a file with the specified multiplication table and saves it to the user's computer.

Working on this project was a great learning experience, and it helped me to develop my skills in Node.js, command-line interfaces, and file system operations. It also allowed me to explore new techniques for creating dynamic and functional applications with Node.js.

Overall, I'm proud of the final result, and I believe it's a strong representation of my abilities as a Node.js developer. I hope this project can inspire other developers to explore the possibilities of Node.js and to create innovative command-line applications that meet the needs of their users.
